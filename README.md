# SignalR Chat

Trying out a chat application using SignalR backend and a React UI.

Been looking at these two sources for this

- [Medium - Creating a simple real-time chat with .NET Core, ReactJS and SignalR](https://medium.com/swlh/creating-a-simple-real-time-chat-with-net-core-reactjs-and-signalr-6367dcadd2c6)
- [Pluralsight - ASP.NET Core 6 SignalR Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-signalr-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
